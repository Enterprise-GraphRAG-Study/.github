# 🚀 Global AI Engineer Readiness Lab (2026)

Welcome to the **Global AI Engineer Readiness Lab**. We are a research-driven engineering group focused on building production-ready, scalable AI systems. Our mission is to bridge the gap between academic research in NLP/Ontology and enterprise-grade AI applications.

### 🎯 Core Research & Engineering Focus
- **Agentic RAG:** Building self-reasoning retrieval systems using LangGraph.
- **Knowledge Integration:** Leveraging **Knowledge Graphs (Neo4j)** and **Ontologies** to solve the limitations of vanilla Vector RAG.
- **LLMOps & Evaluation:** Implementing rigorous evaluation frameworks with **Ragas** and **LangSmith**.
- **Global Collaboration:** Operating under an asynchronous, PR-based engineering culture optimized for remote work.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Async/Await, Pydantic, Type Hinting)
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch, FastAPI, LangChain/LangGraph
- **Data:** Neo4j, Pinecone/Milvus, PostgreSQL
- **DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Ruff/Black

### 🤝 Engineering Excellence (Our Standard)
We strictly follow global engineering standards to ensure code reliability:
1. **Type Safety:** Mandatory type hinting for all Python functions.
2. **Review Culture:** No code merges without at least one peer approval.
3. **Evidence-based:** Every optimization must be backed by quantitative Ragas metrics.
